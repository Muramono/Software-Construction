# Software-Construction
Auburn University's Software Construction class projects/assignments.
The Software Construction Class consisted of 4 main projects 
1. PaymentProgram
  - This was our very first project in the class. It was designed to help us become more familar with c++ as a language and
  refresh on basic programming concepts such as loops etc.
2. ProbabilityGame
  - This was our next assignment. Similarly this was used to help polish and further our understanding of c++ basics. It 
  allowed us to work with loops, functions, and conditional statements.
3. FileStream 
  - This was our third project, it worked on learning more about how streams work in c++. We used streams to read and write 
  between two files.
4. TriviaGame
  - Lastly we had this project where we programed a trivia game. This was done using pointers allowing us to familiarize ourselfs
  with pointers in c++ and understand that importance. It also taught us about test cases and assertion.
